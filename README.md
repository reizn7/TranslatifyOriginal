📝 Translatify – Real-Time Voice Translation for Google Meet
Translatify is a real-time voice translation system built to bridge language barriers during virtual meetings. Designed for platforms like Google Meet, it captures live audio, transcribes speech, translates it into the target language, and plays it back — all in real time.

The project enables global collaboration across language boundaries, making it easier for users to communicate, understand, and participate in meetings without the need for a common spoken language.
